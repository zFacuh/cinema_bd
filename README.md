THE GOAL:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is a fully functional website for a movie theater, specifically focused on the showtime listings and the management of movies and screenings. It includes an integrated database and its complete administrative system.
This idea was born as a school project for the subjects Programming, Databases, and Models & Systems, in the final year of the Information Technology technical program at Instituto Técnico La Piedad.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The goal of publishing this project is to introduce myself to the world as I begin my journey in the field of computer science on this “social network.” My current objective is to find the branch of this career that I enjoy the
most so I can focus on it 100%. After finishing high school, I’m now studying Systems Engineering at the National University of the South, aiming to discover my specialization within this very broad industry.
